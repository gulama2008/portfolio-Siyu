## Overview

This is my personal portfolio project which is built by using all the technologies I have learnt so far as listed below:
- html
- css/scss
- javaScript

## Features
This portfolio has the following sections:
-   A landing section with my name and title on it.
-   An About section with a little about myself.
-   A Tech skills section with all the techs I have learned during the course
-   A Project section with all my projects (currently I'm using placeholder images and will replace them with actual projects after projects done)
-   A Contact section with my email, GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link and a direct message form. The message form is using a form backend tool called FORMSUBMIT and it has the functionality of forwarding the message to my email
